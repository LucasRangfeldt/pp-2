## User Experience

1.As a user, I want to be able to navigate the site on first look.

2.As a user, I want to get straight to the point, no uneccesary clicks

### Design

When writing the quiz questions I had to browse a lot of History websites regarding World War 2, when doing so I realised that most of them was extremely hard to navigate, and also hard to find what I was looking for.
So I went with the exact opposite, background is rather dark, with images at the top that symbolizes learning. After about three seconds as a visitor you will know exactly what the site is about, that's the design I wanted, and that's the design I got.

## Typography

The titles have the font 'Noto Serif Vithkuqi', fallback serif, matched great with the colors.
The  other text snippets on the site, have the font 'Libre Baskerville' also fallback serif.

## Responsive

The site has been tested on ui.dev, responsiveness was achieved using flexbox. And also some media Querys.

## Features

The site has one major feature, a quiz. The quiz was built using Javascript and it has truly been a blast building it. You get faced with a question, and three answers, when you get to the final question
 you have to click 'submit final answer'. After that, starting with the previous question it will show what answer was right, and what was wrong. The wrong answers will be highlighted red. Each question has a picture
that updates with each question. You are not allowed to skip questions.

## Validation

The code has been validated through JShint, W3C validator for HTML and CSS. No errors.

## Bugs

No obvious bugs that I know of at the time, if found, please go to the request page, and submit it there. Thanks.

## Deployment

The site was deployed using GitHub pages.

## Credits

Credit has been implemented in the code, however I will mention it here aswell. All the code has been written by me, but I have taken a lot of help, and reassurance from openAI, and also a close friend.
